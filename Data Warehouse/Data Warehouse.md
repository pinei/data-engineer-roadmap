# Data Warehouse

Data Warehouse should be accountable and auditable - which by default means pushing business rules of changing/altering data downstream to "between the data warehouse and the data marts". 

Solving the business problems in the enterprise:

1) Do not lose data (auditing/compliance)
2) Model it, so you can understand it
3) Make it physical, so you can query it

## Operational Data Warehousing

The principles of a data warehouse are being pushed and re-defined by the business. The business actually builds an operational application right on top of the Data Warehouse, and edits the data set directly, creates new records directly - writing the history back to the warehouse in real time.
