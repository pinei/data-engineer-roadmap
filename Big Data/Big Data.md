# Big Data

Big Data refers to the datasets too large and complex for **RDBMS** or other traditional technologies to capture, store, process, search and analyze. 

The major problems falls under three Vs. 

| **Volume**                                                   | **Velocity**                                                 | **Variety**                                                  | **Veracity**                           |

| - The data is getting generated in multi terabyte quantities.<br />- Social media generates 500 TB of data every day | - There is a need of framework which is capable of high-speed data computations.<br />- Many use cases like credit card fraud detection have only a few seconds to process the data in real-time and detect fraud. | - Technology should have the capability of performing analytics on a variety of data.<br />- Data from various sources have varied formats like text, XML, images, audio, video, etc. | - The need to verify the data quality. |

## Unstructured data

Unstructured means that it is datasets that aren't stored in a structured database format, but through large collections of files stored in file-based systems.

- Sensors
  - Weather data
- Posts to social media sites
  - Opinions, discussions, engagement
- Communications
  - Chat, messaging, web meeting
- Business documents
  - Invoices, emails, productivity / office application items
- Digital pictures, videos and audios
  - Photos, CCTV camera,  911 calls
- Medical records
  - Medical imaging, biosignal data from monitors
- Publications and listings
  - News stories, job listings, movie reviews, invitations
- Web pages
  - Rendered by HTML

Unstructured data has an internal structure, but it's not predefined through data models.

### Challenges

- Scale: itâ€™s common to encounter unstructured datasets at the scale of tens or hundreds of billions of items.
- Collaboration: these unstructured datasets deliver value as they are shared, requiring expensive replication and governance.

### Techniques

Methods and techniques to turn unstructured content into structured data.

- Topic discovery methods (textual)
- Event detection algorithms
- Pattern recognition to interpret image, audio and video content
- Web scraping
- Speech-to-text technology
- Emotion detection
- Classify media files
