# Big Data

Big Data refers to the datasets too large and complex for **RDBMS** or other traditional technologies to capture, store, process, search and analyze.

Big Data is a combination of unstructured, semi-structured or structured data collected by organizations.

The major problems falls under the **five** main and innate characteristics of Big Data. 

| 5 Vs                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Volume**                                                   |
| - The data is getting generated in multi terabyte quantities.<br />- We have to think about how are we going to store and access all this data.<br />- What is considered to be big data will change depending on the available computing power that's on the market. |
| **Velocity**                                                 |
| - Refers to how quickly data is generated, moved around, and processed.<br />- Many use cases like credit card fraud detection have only a few seconds to process the data in real-time and detect fraud.<br />- Data needs to be digested, queried and analyzed quickly, sometimes in near real time. |
| **Variety**                                                  |
| - Technology should have the capability of performing analytics on a variety of data.<br />- Data from different sources have varied types and formats like text, XML, images, audio, video, etc.<br />- Analysts usually work with structured and semi-structured data that can generally be coerced into some kind of tabular format (like a spreadsheet) or charts, but many businesses are also collecting and processing unstructured data like video files and social media posts.  |
| **Veracity**                                                 |
| - Refers to the quality and accuracy of data<br />- A large amount of data can cause more confusion than insights if it's incomplete or inconsistent. | 
| **Value**                                                    |
| - Refers to what organizations can do with that collected data to derive value.<br />- Extracting value from big data can be really complicated.<br />- It needs to be transformed into shareable, actionable insights and made visible to the larger organization. |

## Unstructured data

Unstructured means that it is datasets that aren't stored in a structured database format, but through large collections of files stored in file-based systems.

- Sensors
  - Weather data
- Posts to social media sites
  - Opinions, discussions, engagement
- Communications
  - Chat, messaging, web meeting
- Business documents
  - Invoices, emails, productivity / office application items
- Digital pictures, videos and audios
  - Photos, CCTV camera,  911 calls
- Medical records
  - Medical imaging, biosignal data from monitors
- Publications and listings
  - News stories, job listings, movie reviews, invitations
- Web pages
  - Rendered by HTML

Unstructured data has an internal structure, but it's not predefined through data models.

### Challenges

- Scale: itâ€™s common to encounter unstructured datasets at the scale of tens or hundreds of billions of items.
- Collaboration: these unstructured datasets deliver value as they are shared, requiring expensive replication and governance.

### Techniques

Methods and techniques to turn unstructured content into structured data.

- Topic discovery methods (textual)
- Event detection algorithms
- Pattern recognition to interpret image, audio and video content
- Web scraping
- Speech-to-text technology
- Emotion detection
- Classify media files
